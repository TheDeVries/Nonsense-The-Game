## Project Description
 __Nonsense: The Game__ is a pixelated horror game under a facade of simplicity. Gameplay goes a little bit like this: The player is led through an assortment of games and scenarios that are rotated according to a randomized timer. Success in each scene will raise the player’s score. Failure will decrease the sanity meter, resulting in a series of undesirable graphical, audio, and logical distortions. It’s game over once the sanity meter reaches zero.

## User Interface Design
* A wireframe or drawing of the user interface concept along with a short description of the interface. You should have one for each screen in your program.
    * For example, if your program has a start screen, game screen, and game over screen, you should include a wireframe / screenshot / drawing of each one and a short description of the components
    * You should also have a screenshot of your final GUI

***        

## Program Design
* You should have a list of any additional libraries or modules used (pygame, request) beyond non-standard python.
    * For each additional module you should include
        * url for the module documentation
        * a short description of the module
* Decide upon a class interface for the classes in your project.
    * A simple drawing that shows the class relationships in your code (see the sample Proposal document for an example).
    * This does not need to be overly detailed, but should show how your code fits into the Model/View/Controller paradigm.
* You should have a list of each of your classes with a description.
